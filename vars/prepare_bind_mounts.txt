Prepare and validate host bind-mount directories before Docker or Docker Compose deploys.

Usage:
  prepare_bind_mounts(
    mounts: [
      [host: '/srv/myapp/uploads', container: '/app/uploads'],
      [host: '/srv/myapp/logs', container: '/app/logs']
    ],
    image: 'my-registry.example.com/myapp/backend:build-123'
  )

Alternative image input:
  prepare_bind_mounts(
    mounts: [[host: '/srv/app/data', container: '/app/data']],
    imageName: env.IMAGE_NAME,
    imageTag: env.IMAGE_TAG
  )

Parameters:
  mounts (required list)
    List of maps with `host` and `container` paths.
  image (optional)

  allowSudo (optional boolean, default: true)
    Attempt passwordless sudo ownership fix when not running as root.
  validateWithDocker (optional boolean, default: true)
    Run a Docker-based write test using the runtime uid/gid.
  validationEntrypoint (optional, default: /nodejs/bin/node)
    Entrypoint used for validation (override for non-Node images).
